Briefly explanation:
<b>Firstly</b>, add observation with 'New video' button. Every TikTok = one observation. Add your videos data and then use statistical tests to know what brings you more likes and views. <b>The more import data, the better the result statistics</b>ðŸ“ˆ.
<b>Secondly</b>, after adding data, you can get your results by pressing the 'Statistics' button. Then choose, what test's result you need to explore.A) - Correlation Analysis, which can tell you the strength of relationship between two quantitative variables(<b>e.g.The longer the video, the more views</b>)  especially for your entered data. And B) - t-test, which returns boxplots for a feature with statistically significant differences(<b>e.g. If your TikToks with sunshine in gains more popularity then without it, it will send you a boxplot with this information</b>).
<b>Thirdly</b>, use 'Clean data' button to delete either the last observation or the whole data.
<b>To sum up</b>, This is how you use this bot: regularly adding data about your TikToks(don't forget to wait until the view and like rates are fixed), then use statistics to mine some insights about your video-content. Contacts:@paleasfuck'''
