# Statistical telegram bot
How it works?

Firstly, add observation with 'New video' button. Every TikTok = one observation. Add your videos' data and then use statistical tests to know what brings you more likes and views. *The more import data, the better the result statistics*ðŸ“ˆ.
Secondly, after adding data, you can get your results by pressing the 'Statistics' button. Then choose, what test's result you need to explore. A) - Correlation Analysis, which can tell you the strength of relationship between two quantitative variables(*e.g.The longer the video, the more views*) especially for your entered data. And B) - t-test, which returns boxplots for a feature with statistically significant differences(*e.g. If your TikToks with sunshine in gains more popularity then without it, it will send you a boxplot with this information*). Thirdly, use 'Clean data' button to delete either the last observation or the whole data.
To sum up, this is how you use this bot: regularly adding data about your TikToks(don't forget to wait until the view and like rates are fixed), then use statistics to mine some insights about your video-content. As an administrator, I can get all the data in the form of a .csv file of all users for further analysis.

To launch the bot use the bot.py file, after installing all the packages from the requirements.txt file

Before launching, you need to enter the token of your bot, created in @BotFather, in the misc.py file, in the line "bot = Bot (token = 'YOUR TOKEN')".
And also in the line "admin_id = 0" replace the value of the variable with your ID without quotes.
You can find out your ID using the @myidbot bot and the "/ getid" command.

The "/ start" command is a starting command in a dialogue with a bot, as well as a command to return to the main menu under any circumstances.

Before starting a dialogue with the bot, you must turn off the privacy setting in the telegram along the path "Settings -> Confidentiality -> Forwarding messages -> Who can refer to my account when forwarding messages -> All".
