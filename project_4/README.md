# Analysis and EDA + basic predict model for TripAdvisor restaurants database
It seems like some resraurants be 'boosting' their rating with fake reviews. I built a model which predict Restaurant Rating so we can compare my predict and real value. In case there is a large difference - we should check if this restaurant's reviews are fair.
